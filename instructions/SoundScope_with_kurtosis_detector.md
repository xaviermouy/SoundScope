# Kurtosis detector

The kurtosis detector is a generic detector that detects impulsive signals in a given frequency band. It is used for example to detect haddock sounds, humpback whale negaptclicks and pile driving sounds.The detector saves resulst as Raven tables. These instructions show how to convert these detection results into a format that SoundScope can use.

## Setting up the python environment
1. Create a python environment with python 3.10 (e.g. using Anaconda)
2. install the library ecosound
'''
pip install ecosound
'''


## Convert Raven table to ecosound NetCDF files


## Load detections in SoundScope
